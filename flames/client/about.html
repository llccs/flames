<h3>What is Sled Hockey?</h3>

<p>Ice hockey, played in lightweight sleds which balance on top of two skate blades placed anywhere from one to four inches apart.  Players use two sticks instead of one, with metal picks on one end for propulsion.  All other equipment and most rules are the same as standing ice hockey, including checking.  
</p>

<h3>Who can play?</h3>

<p>Anyone.  Devised by players who could not skate due to physical disability, anyone is welcome to come get in a sled and try it out, and both disabled and nondisabled players can compete together at the local and regional levels.  Players must have a qualifying physical disability to represent the USA in international competition.
